! EXAM 12.
!   This job illustrates linear bends, for acetylene, and
!   tests the closed shell LDA density functional program.
!
!   At the input geometry,
!   the FINAL E= -76.5352218453 after 12 iterations,
!   and the RMS gradient is 0.0944650.
!
!   At the optimized geometry, 5 steps later,
!   the FINAL E= -76.5841366194, RMS gradient=0.0000007,
!   R(CC)=1.21191 and R(CH)=1.07798.
