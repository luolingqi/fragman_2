There are a few changes to the standard rungms script which hopefully make
it easier to get up and running with GAMESS. scratch files default to the
current directory as does the .dat and .irc files. If you wish to setup a
seperate scratch directory edit the SCR= line in rungms. If you wish to 
install the gamess executables in a standard location edit the GMSPATH line
in the rungms script.

Finally I have included a gms script to simplify running GAMESS jobs 
interactively. To use it just type:

  ./gms inputname

where inputname is the name of your gamess input file. That will run GAMESS
and return when the run is finished. The output is stored in inputname.log. 

If you would like to install the binaries in a "known" location and add
the gms command to your path there are a few changes to make. First off
pick your location and move the rungms, gamess.*.x, ddikick.x, ericfmt.dat
and the entire mcpdata directory to that location. Then edit the rungms 
script to use that path where it sets up GMSPATH. Finally edit the gms 
script to point to the location of the rungms script and put it in a 
location that will be on your path.
