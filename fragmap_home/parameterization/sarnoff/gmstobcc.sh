This shell script allows Gamess to be used instead of divcon (or mopac)
for assigning AM1-BCC charges using Antechamber.  The input is a Gamess
output file and this is converted to an antechamber file (with atom
types, atom positions, bond types and partial charges).  Partial charges
are calculated using the AM1-BCC model and these charges are symmetrized
between equivalent atoms using chargesym.  Gamess must be run in such a
way as to compute the required AM1 charges.  Typical input to Gamess
should therefore include

 \$BASIS GBASIS=AM1 \$END

A suitable input file can be created with gjftogms -a.  Run as a filter,
for example:

    gms methanol 2>&1 | tee methanol.log | $0 > methanol.ac

Options:

    $0 [-d] [-h] [-c]

By default the charge are symmetrizing by chargesym (which must be in
your PATH).  This makes chemically equivalent atoms have the same
charge.  Optional argument -c skips this step.

Optional argument -d retains the temporary directory (under ${TMPDIR:-/tmp})
for debugging.

Optional argument -h prints this message.

gmstobcc depends upon OpenBabel and Antechamber.  These must be
installed and be in your PATH.  Furthermore environment variable
AMBERHOME must be defined for Antechamber.
