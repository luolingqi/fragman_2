This collection of scripts was written by Sarnoff to help prepare
organic molecules for simulation.  These scripts rely heavily on the
following software packages:
<ol>
<li> Antechamber,
<a href="http://amber.scripps.edu/antechamber/antechamber.html">http://amber.scripps.edu/antechamber/antechamber.html</a>
<li> RESP,
<a href="http://amber.scripps.edu/ftp/plep.tar.gz">http://amber.scripps.edu/ftp/plep.tar.gz</a>
<li> OpenBabel,
<a href="http://openbabel.sourceforge.net">http://openbabel.sourceforge.net</a>
<li> Gamess,
<a href="http://www.msg.ameslab.gov/GAMESS/GAMESS.html">http://www.msg.ameslab.gov/GAMESS/GAMESS.html</a>
<li> Gromacs,
<a href="http://www.gromacs.org">http://www.gromacs.org</a>
</ol>
Our thanks to the authors of these packages.

Here are the main objectives of these scripts:
<ul><li>Allow Gamess to be used in conjunction with Antechamber for the
assignment of partial charges by the RESP or AM1-BCC methods.
<li>
Add hydrogens to a PDB file using Gromacs and adjust atom names and
certain bond angles to conform to Amber's rules.
</ul>
A couple of shortcomings of Antechamber are addressed.
<ul><li>
The charges produced by the AM1-BCC method are symmetrized between
chemically equivalent atoms (using respgen's symmetry detection).
<li>
Antechamber produces several temporary files which mean that it is
unsafe to run multiple instances within the same directory.  This
is addressed by placing the temporary files in a unique directory.
</ul>
<p>These scripts are written as filters expecting input on stdin and
producing output on stdout.  Diagnostic messages appear on stderr.
Generally a -h option produces a description of the script.  A -d option
causes the temporary directory to be retained for diagnostic purposes.
The auxiliary programs that these scripts call should be located in
your PATH.  These scripts were written and tested under Linux.  They
should work on other Unix platforms.  (It is possible that we rely on
GNU awk extensions.  Let us know if this is the case.)
<p>
Here is a quick description of the scripts.  More complete documentation
is obtained by running the script with the -h option.
<ul><li>
<a href="gjftogcrt.sh">gjftogcrt</a>:
Converts a general Gaussian input file (possibly in mixed
Z-matrix and Cartesian form) into a pure Cartesian representation.
<li>
<a href="gjftogms.sh">gjftogms</a>:
Converts a Gaussian input file to a Gamess format.  It does
this by invoking gjftogcrt and using Antechamber to convert the result
to a Z-matrix form.  The Z-matrix input allows the use of delocalized
coordinates during geometry optimization by Gamess.  acreorder is used
to reorder of the atoms in order that the Z-matrix makes sense.
<li>
<a href="gmstoresp.sh">gmstoresp</a>:
Converts the log file produced with Gamess to an Antechamber
file with RESP charges.  The input file for Gamess can be created with
gjftogms -r.  OpenBabel is used to extract the coordinate information
for the output file.  RESP and Antechamber are used to calculate the
charges and create the output file.  (The starting point for this script
was one written by Hans De Winter, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,
<a href="mailto:hans@s151h14.rega.kuleuven.ac.be">hans@s151h14.rega.kuleuven.ac.be</a>,
which is provided with the RESP
distribution.)
<li>
<a href="gmstobcc.sh">gmstobcc</a>:
Converts the log file produced with Gamess to an Antechamber
file with AM1-BCC charges.  The input file for Gamess can be created
with gjftogms -a.  OpenBabel is used to extract the coordinate
information for the output file.  A work-alike divcon output file is
created and Antechamber is invoked requesting AM1-BCC charges.  (This
invokes divcon for which we use a dummy script.)  Finally we invoke
chargesym to symmetrize the charges.
<li>
<a href="divcon.sh">divcon</a>:
A dummy divcon program (which merely copies the previously
prepared output file to divcon.out).  The Makefile copies this to
$AMBERHOME/exe.
<li>
<a href="chargesym.sh">chargesym</a>:
This symmetrizes the charges in an Antechamber file using
respgen to identify equivalent atoms.
<li>
<a href="acreorder.sh">acreorder</a>:
Reorders the atoms in an Antechamber file following the bonds
from a starting atom.  This is sometimes necessary as a precursor to
converting the molecule to a Z-matrix representation.
<li>
<a href="addhydrogens.sh">addhydrogens</a>:
Adds the hydrogens to the protein in a PDB file.  This
invokes the Gromacs tool, pdb2gmx, to add hydrogens.  The result is
fixed up to comply with Amber conventions by g96topdb.
<a href="gromacs.patch">gromacs.patch</a>
contains a patch
to gromacs 3.2.1 to correct the angles in NH2 groups.
<li>
<a href="g96topdb.sh">g96topdb</a>:
Reads in a Gromacs96 (g96) file, performs OPLS to Amber atom
type and residue translation, replaces hydrogen bond lengths with bond
lengths consistent with Amber force field, corrects for the SH bond
angle in CYS, and finally writes the result to a pdb file.  Amber
residue variants by including the variant code (ASH, CYX, GLH, HID, HIE,
or LYN) in columns 73-75 of the output.
<li>
<a href="gjfrenumber.sh">gjfrenumber</a>:
Reads in a Gaussian input file and renumbers the atoms and
converts numerical indexes in Z-matrix lines into symbolic indexes.
This would allow two molecules in Z-matrix format to be bonded together
with a straightforward edit of the files.
<li>
<a href="antechamberfilt.sh">antechamberfilt</a> and
<a href="babelfilt.sh">babelfilt</a>:
These are simple scripts that change
antechamber and babel into filters so that they can be used in pipes.
