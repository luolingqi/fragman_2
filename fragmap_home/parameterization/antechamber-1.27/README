This is Antechamber, version 1.24; it is functionally similar to the version
that is included in Amber 8, but contains some bug-fixes and parameter updates.
Two new programs, top2mol2 and charmmgen are added. See the following site 
for more detail:

     http://amber.scripps.edu/antechamber/antechamber.html

For convenience, we are also including versions of tleap and mopac6, which are
often used in conjunction with Antechamber.

Documentation is in the file doc/AC.pdf.  Chapter 1 has information on
installing and testing; Chapter 2 describes the programs; Chapter 3 describes
tleap, which is also included here for convenience.  Documentation for mopac
is in the mopac6/doc directory.
