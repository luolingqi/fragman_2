LIGPLOT is a program that automatically generates schematic 2D
representations of protein-ligand interactions. The input is a
standard PDB file and the output is a colour or black-and-white
PostScript file which gives a simple, at-a-glance representation of
the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein and
ligand. The program is completely general and can be used to show
other interactions such as helix-helix interactions, protein-DNA
interactions, etc.

The latest version (v.4.0) of the LIGPLOT program is available via
anonymous ftp on ftp.biochem.ucl.ac.uk, from the directory:-

                        pub/ligplot

This contains a two compressed tar files and a Confidentiality Agreement:

                        ligplot.tar.Z.enc
                        manual.tar.Z
                        confid.txt

Use "get" to retrieve all three files. Note that the ligplot.tar.Z.enc
file is encrypted and requires a decryption key.

Alternatively you can these files via the Web from:-

     http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/ligplot/ligplot.html

Then, do the following:-

   1. Print off the Confidentiality Agreement, confid.txt. Complete all
      the relevant information, sign it and either fax or post it to
      the address given at the bottom of this file.

      If yours is an academic institution you will then receive the
      decryption key without charge. Please make sure you include your
      e-mail address so that the key can be despatched to you as soon
      as possible.

      For non-academic users, there is a consultancy fee of 500 pounds
      sterling which includes the source code for both LIGPLOT and HBPLUS.
      Please enquire by e-mail to Eoin Murphy at e.murphy@ucl.ac.uk.

      Note that, if you have already completed a Confidentiality Agreement
      for an earlier version of LIGPLOT, then you do not need to send
      in another one. Just send an e-mail message requesting the 
      current decryption key.

   2. The program documentation is not encrypted, so you can install that
      straight away.

      Uncompress and untar the file manual.tar.Z as follows:-

                        uncompress manual.tar.Z
                        tar -xvf manual.tar

      This will create a new directory called "manual" which will contain
      the program's operating instructions in HTML format.

      To view the instructions use a Web browser, such as Netscape or
      Mosaic, to call up the contents page: index.html.

      For example, with Netscape, type

                        netscape manual/index.html &

-----------------

If you have earlier versions of LIGPLOT, please note that, from v.3.0,
the name of the parameter file has changed from ligplot.par to ligplot.prm
as the format differs from the earlier versions.

*** The parameter file in the latest version (v.4.0) has several new
options, so delete any existing copies of ligplot.prm before running the
new programs so that you can use these new options.

As before, the parameter file is created when you first run LIGPLOT if
it is absent from the current working directory. So the latest parameter
file is always created after you have deleted any old copies.

Note that, if you still have parameter files from LIGPLOT v.1.0 (which
were also called ligplot.prm) please delete these before running the
new versions of the programs.

Note also, that the decryption code for v.4.0 (and later) is different from
that for earlier versions.



HBPLUS - for computing hydrogen bonds
-------------------------------------
We recommend you use the program HBPLUS (written by Ian McDonald) for
calculating the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts to be plotted by
LIGPLOT.

This program is available by anonymous ftp from the same address
(ie ftp.biochem.ucl.ac.uk) and can be found in the directory pub/hbplus.

For further details, see

      http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/~mcdonald/hbplus/home.html


Note that, HBPLUS was designed for computing hydrogen bonds within
proteins, so it often has problems on encountering an unrecognized
ligand molecule. As a consequence it often misses important H-bonds,
which then do not appear on the LIGPLOT diagram. It is possible to
define molecules manually (in terms of which atoms are H-bond
donors/acceptors, etc) so that HBPLUS knows how to treat them.

An alternative, automatic method - which works in most cases - is the
HBADD program supplied with v.3.0 (and later) of LIGPLOT. This program
aims to generate molecule definitions in HBPLUS format from the data
in the Het Group Dictionary, which is available from the PDB.

The Het Group Dictionary can be picked up from:-

      ftp://pdb.pdb.bnl.gov/pub/resources/hetgroups/het_dictionary.txt

Alternatively, check for PDB mirror sites at:-

      http://www.pdb.bnl.gov/mirror_sites.html



NACCESS - for computing atom accessibilities
--------------------------------------------
You might also like to use the NACCESS program (written by Simon Hubbard)
for computing the solvent accessibilities of ligand atoms. The different
accessibilities can be shown on the LIGPLOT as different shades/colour
behind each of the ligand atoms. NACCESS is also available by anonymous ftp
from 128.40.46.11, being in directory pub/naccess.

For further details, see

      http://sjh.bi.umist.ac.uk/naccess.html



Program changes for v.4.0
-------------------------

1. DIMPLOT - A version of LIGPLOT that plots residue-residue interactions
across an interface - be it a protein dimer-dimer interface or an interface
between two domains within the same protein. Residues on one side of the
interface are plotted down the left-hand side of the page and those from
the other are printed down the right.

2. New routines to help obtain similar LIGPLOTs in cases where you have two
(or more) structures of the same protein with different ligands bound.

Each time LIGPLOT is run a new file (extension .rcm) is output containing
the centres of mass of each of the flattened residues on the plot. These
positions can, in turn, be used to restrain the equivalent residues in a
subsequent LIGPLOT so that they appear in approximately the same locations
as before. Further atomic restraints can also be added to this file to
fine-tune the positioning of the ligand and protein sidechains on the plot.

3. Inclusion of residue name in the residue range when running LIGPLOT.

Normally, LIGPLOT is run by giving the residue range and chain-id as
follows:-

      ligplot p1atn.pdb 18 20 D

In many PDB files, however, the residue numbers alone can be ambiguous. In
the case of 1atn, for example, the protein also contains residues 18-20,
labelled chain D. In the past, LIGPLOT has had to guess which are the most
likely residues required.

To overcome this ambiguity, however, you can now prefix the residue numbers
with the residue names:-

      ligplot p1atn.pdb NAG 18 MAN 20 D

4. Compatibility with the current version of NACCESS.



Program changes between v.3.2 and v.3.1.2
-----------------------------------------
1. Addition of a simple graph-matching algorithm to hbadd to match up atoms
in the Het Groups in your PDB file to the corresponding entries in the Het
Group Dictionary. So, even if the atom-names differ, or are in a different
order, hbadd should be able to handle Het Groups that are present in the
dictionary.

2. Addition of 3 new options in the ligplot.prm file:-

   1. A rotation angle for rotating the final plot on the page.
   2. An option to show covalent bonds between the ligand and external
      residues as solid lines rather than as dotted lines.
   3. An option for including additional non-bonded contacts, other than
      just hydrophobic contacts.

Thus you should delete any existing copies of ligplot.prm before running
the program to allow it to create new versions corresponding to the new set
of parameters.


Program changes between v.3.1.2 and v.3.1.1
-------------------------------------------
1. Speed-up of CONECT record processing for NMR structures with large
numbers of CONECTs.

2. Better handling of metal ligands by fooling HBPLUS into finding
interactions between sidechains and metals.


Program changes between v.3.1.1 and v.3.1
-----------------------------------------
Handling of cyclic peptides and complex sugars improved.


Program changes between v.3.0 and v.3.1
---------------------------------------
Various amendments, including:-

1. Significant speed-up of program by cutting out very many unnecessary
calls to the most computationally intensive routines.

2. Amendments to cope with some of the peculiarities of PDB files, such as
duplicate residue names, and HET group attachments to residues.

3. Amendments to hbadd program to generate an HBPLUS entry for residues
missing from the Het Group Dictionary when the PDB file contains hydrogen
atoms in the HET group.


Program changes between v.2.0 and v.3.0
---------------------------------------
The following enhancements have been made to the LIGPLOT program for
v.3.0:-

1. Addition of HBADD program, making use of the Het Group Dictionary,
to generate an HBPLUS input file to help that program calculate hydrogen
bonds.

2. Complete rewrite of most routines, including the energy minimization
protocol for generating the final diagram. Final plots produced are
generally a great improvement on those generated by v.2.0 and earlier.

3. Improvements to the "Simple "Residue" representation, including addition
of hydrophobic contacts to this plot.

4. Ligand can now be a single atom (eg a metal ion).

5. 2D residue representations are more representative of the original 3D
conformation as all internal atom-atom distances in the 2D version are
matched against those in the 3D original.


Program changes between v.1.2 and v.2.0
---------------------------------------
The following enhancements have been made to the LIGPLOT program for
v.2.0:-

1. Completely revised set of input parameters, including many new
parameters, particularly those defining the colours and sizes of the
different items and labels plotted. Portrait/landscape option added. Name
of input parameter file changed from ligplot.prm to ligplot.par to prevent
confusion with former version.

2. Changes to PostScript output routines to make the output PostScript file
simpler to understand and edit.

3. Several bugs in v.1.2 found and fixed.

4. Double- and triple-bond option added (these have to be manually defined,
though, as described in the Operating Manual).

5. Read-in and use of CONECT records in input PDB file.

6. Output of ligplot.frm file giving original coordinates, in PDB format,
of all the residues shown on the LIGPLOT diagram.

7. Operating instructions in HTML format.
